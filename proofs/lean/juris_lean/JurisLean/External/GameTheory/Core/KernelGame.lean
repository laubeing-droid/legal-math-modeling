This copy differs from the revision above in exactly two ways: this
header block, and `import` module paths rewritten to the
`JurisLean.External.*` roots. Statements and proofs are unchanged;
tests/spec/test_external_port_provenance.py re-derives the upstream
bytes from this file and checks the recorded sha256.
No build attestation is claimed here: the first compile of this port
is booked in PENDING_CI_MODULES (scripts/ci/check_import_reachability.py)
and only a green CI run of a commit containing this file can attest it.

# GameTheory.Core.KernelGame

Kernel-based game structure: the semantic core for finite/discrete game models.

Provides:
- `KernelGame` — a game with player-indexed strategies, stochastic outcome kernel, and utility
- `eu` — expected utility for a player under a strategy profile
- `Profile`, `correlatedOutcome` — standard game-theoretic notions
- `KernelGame.ofEU` — constructs a kernel game from a direct EU function
