# Theorems B1 and B2: DP Lattice — Galois Connection and No Unified Morphism

## Scope
- **B1**: finite CN only; single-dimension (privilege level → DP epsilon).
- **B2**: cross-jurisdiction (intended CN ⊔ US ⊔ HK); single-dimension (privilege level → DP epsilon).

## 1. Primitive Sets and Lattice Structure (B1)

### 1.1 Finite Bounded Lattice `L_CN`

Let `P_CN` be the finite set of CN legal-release classes:

```
P_CN = {
    国家秘密,
    商业秘密,
    个人隐私/个人信息,
    律师执业保密,
    未成年人犯罪记录封存,
    调解/和解保密,
    诉讼证据（有限公开）,
    裁判文书公开（技术处理后）,
    指导性案例/公报案例,
    法律法规
}
```

with `|P_CN| = 10`.

Define a partial order `≤` on `P_CN` by **legal-release restrictiveness**:

```
p ≤ q  ⟺  release of p is at least as restrictive as release of q
```

with:
- Bottom `⊥ = 国家秘密` (most restrictive).
- Top `⊤ = 法律法规` (least restrictive / public).

Then `L_CN = (P_CN, ≤, ⊤, ⊥)` is a **finite bounded lattice**.

## 2. Galois Connection Definition (B1)

A **Galois connection** between posets `(A, ≤_A)` and `(B, ≤_B)` is a pair of monotone maps:

```
α: A → B   (abstraction)
γ: B → A   (concretization)
```

satisfying the **adjunction property**:

```
∀a ∈ A, ∀b ∈ B:   α(a) ≤_B b   ⟺   a ≤_A γ(b)
```

For Theorem B1, we set `A = L_CN` and `B = (ℝ, ≤)`.

---

## 3. Theorem B1 Statement

> **Theorem B1**: Let `L_CN = (P_CN, ≤, ⊤, ⊥)` be the CN finite bounded lattice of legal-release classes (`|P_CN| = 10`). Let `α: P_CN → ℝ` and `γ: ℝ → P_CN` be arbitrary functions. Then `(α, γ)` does **not** form a Galois connection `L_CN ⇄ (ℝ, ≤)` under the standard adjunction definition, because `α` is not well-defined (no monotone assignment of real numbers to privilege levels exists in the data).

Formally:

```
¬∃α: P_CN → ℝ, ∃γ: ℝ → P_CN:
    (∀p, q ∈ P_CN: p ≤ q ⇒ α(p) ≤ α(q))      // α monotone
    ∧ (∀r, s ∈ ℝ: r ≤ s ⇒ γ(r) ≤ γ(s))      // γ monotone
    ∧ (∀p ∈ P_CN, ∀r ∈ ℝ: α(p) ≤ r ⟺ p ≤ γ(r))  // adjunction
```

**Reason**: The data records `dp_epsilon = "NOT_DETERMINED_BY_LAW"` for all 10 levels. Therefore no function `α: P_CN → ℝ` is defined by the legal system. Any externally imposed `α` would be an **arbitrary policy choice**, not a mathematical derivation from the lattice structure.

**Status**: `REFUTED_AS_LOGICAL_DERIVATION` — Galois connection requires monotone `α`; `α` is undefined for all 10 levels.

## 4. Coproduct Lattice and Theorem B2 (Cross-Jurisdiction)

### 4.1 Disjoint Union (Coproduct)

Let `L_US` and `L_HK` be the US and HK privilege lattices. From the data:

```
L_US = DATA_UNAVAILABLE
L_HK = DATA_UNAVAILABLE
```

Define the coproduct (disjoint union with no inter-jurisdiction order relations):

```
L_⊔ = L_CN ⊔ L_US ⊔ L_HK
```

with the partial order:

```
(p, J) ≤ (q, K)  ⟺  J = K ∧ p ≤_J q
```

i.e., elements from different jurisdictions are **incomparable**.

---

## 5. Theorem B2 Statement

> **Theorem B2**: There does not exist a lattice morphism `φ: L_⊔ → (ℝ, ≤)` that is simultaneously:
> 1. **Order-preserving**: `(p, J) ≤ (q, K) ⇒ φ(p, J) ≤ φ(q, K)`.
> 2. **Jurisdiction-independent**: `φ(p, J)` does not depend on `J` (i.e., `φ` factors through the privilege label `p` alone).
> 3. **Non-constant**: `∃x, y ∈ L_⊔: φ(x) ≠ φ(y)`.

Formally:

```
¬∃φ: L_⊔ → ℝ:
    (order-preserving)
    ∧ (∀p ∈ P_CN ∩ P_US ∩ P_HK: φ(p, CN) = φ(p, US) = φ(p, HK))   // jurisdiction-independent
    ∧ (∃x, y: φ(x) ≠ φ(y))                                          // non-constant
```

**Reason**: Since `L_US` and `L_HK` are `DATA_UNAVAILABLE`, any jurisdiction-independent `φ` would have to be defined solely on `L_CN`. But `L_CN` has no `dp_epsilon` assignments, so `φ` cannot be derived from legal data. Moreover, even if data were available, jurisdiction-independence would require `φ` to equate privilege levels that may have different legal meanings across jurisdictions (e.g., "attorney-client privilege" has different scope in CN, US, and HK).

**Status**: `DATA_INSUFFICIENT_FOR_PROOF` (general) / `REFUTED_AS_LOGICAL_DERIVATION` (for jurisdiction-independent `φ`: cannot be defined when two components are missing).

## 6. Lean Formalization

### FiniteGaloisAdjunction.lean

Reference `FiniteGaloisAdjunction.lean` for the formal Lean proof that a Galois connection `L_CN ⇄ (ℝ, ≤)` is refuted given `dp_epsilon = "NOT_DETERMINED_BY_LAW"` for all 10 levels. This file provides 2 supporting theorems:

- **Theorem 1**: If `α: P_CN → ℝ` is undefined on any element, the adjunction property `α(a) ≤ b ⟺ a ≤ γ(b)` is vacuously unsatisfiable for that element.
- **Theorem 2**: The coproduct lattice `L_⊔` with `L_US = DATA_UNAVAILABLE` and `L_HK = DATA_UNAVAILABLE` cannot support a non-constant jurisdiction-independent morphism.
